<H1> Read Me </H1>

This is a static webpage hosted for the Epub version of "Lever Action" by J.T. Smith. Which is part of a writing project called A Reaper's Bounty, which is planning to span around four books. The book is available to read here for free, but this is currently a book that is being drafted, so expect errors and continuous changes.

I created the static website using ChatGPT3-o to code and provide advice for the site. I don't have much coding experience, except for minor troubleshooting and a little html knowledge. If you think there are improvements, feel free to contribute.
